 * @param {string[]} params.resourceIds - An array of resource IDs to check.
 * @param {string} params.organizationId - The ID of the organization for security.
 * @param {mongoose.Model} params.ResourceModel - The Mongoose model for resources.
 * @returns {Promise<string[]>} A promise that resolves to an array of blockable resource IDs.
